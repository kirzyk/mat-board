# MatBoard 🎯

> _"Because every company needs a board to manage their mats... or was it orders? 🤔"_

## What's Inside 🎁

- **Authentication System**: Because we can't have just anyone managing mats... I mean orders
- **Search & Filter**: Find that needle in the haystack (or that specific order in the chaos)
- **Pagination**: Because nobody likes scrolling through 10,000 orders
- **Modern UI**: Material Design that makes your eyes happy
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and probably your smart fridge

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Angular 19** - Because we like to live on the edge
- **Angular Material** - For that sweet, sweet Material Design
- **RxJS** - Reactive programming that's actually fun
- **TypeScript** - Because `any` is not a type (fight me)
- **UUID** - For generating unique IDs that are actually unique
- **LocalStorage** - Because we're keeping it simple (and offline-friendly)

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version that's not too old, not too new, just right)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone <repository-url>
cd mat-board

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and prepare to be amazed! 🎉

## Features That Make Me Proud 😎

- **Mock Authentication**: Login with any email/password combo (because we're rebels)
- **Real-time Search**: Type and watch the magic happen
- **Beautiful Empty States**: Because empty doesn't have to mean boring
- **Smooth Animations**: Everything moves like butter
- **Accessibility**: Because everyone deserves a great UX
- **Clean Code**: Because future me will thank past me

## Final Thoughts 💭

This project represents not just a technical solution, but also my enthusiasm for joining a team that clearly knows how to conduct an interview. The attention to detail, the modern tech stack, and the focus on user experience all reflect what I believe makes for great software development.
